# Mileage Prediction Model

## Objective
Develop a mileage prediction model using linear regression based on vehicle features such as displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration to predict miles per gallon (mpg).

## Explanation
This project leverages linear regression to predict mpg from vehicle characteristics, aiming to help in understanding and improving fuel efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **displacement**: Engine displacement
- **horsepower**: Engine horsepower
- **weight**: Vehicle weight
- **acceleration**: Acceleration time
- **mpg**: Miles per gallon (target variable)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional for visualization)

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
